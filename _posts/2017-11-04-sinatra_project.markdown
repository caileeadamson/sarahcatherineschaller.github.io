My Sinatra Portfolio Project took me significantly less time to start and complete than my CLI project, probably because I was more confident in my abilities. My CLI project took me weeks, most of which was spent feeling overwhelmed because I didn't even know where to begin. This project took me only a few days and I felt like I knew what I was doing before I began. Like my last project, the most challenging part for me was consistently saving my work on GitHub after every few lines, but it felt like less of a struggle this time. 

For the project, users can signup with a username, email, and password and add items to their "bucketlist". After you add an item, it takes you to the individual bucketlist item show page, where you can edit or delete the item, or go back to your list of cool things you want to do before you die. The list has a link to each individual item to edit or delete when needed. Only the user currently signed in can view their own saved bucketlist items. Usernames and passwords are securely saved so a user can login and logout without losing their list.
