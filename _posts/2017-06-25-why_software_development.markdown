I’m sitting on a picnic table outside in the courtyard of the school where I teach middle school math. It’s a beautiful, warm spring afternoon and I’m on duty to coach the boy’s 4th-8th grade intramural sports teams this season. They are playing Man Hunt today, a game where one team hides and makes their way to a base (the picnic table I am sitting on), and the other team tries to tag them before they get to safety. It’s a treat that they get to play this game today, they know this. If they misbehave, they’re out of the game. They know this. 

It’s been a half hour of the same type of game, and the boys (plus one 4th grade girl who broke her thumb and can no longer play on the softball team) are getting restless. I start to feel a shift in behavior. 

“Let’s start a new game,” I say, “New teams,” hoping to push off any tension that is starting to brew for even a few more minutes. “Stephen and Andrew, you’re the team captains. Stephen, you pick first.” (names changed because kids)

“I choose Nick,” Stephen says. 

“I’m not going on his team,” says Nick.

“Then you will not play this round,” I tell him, gently but firmly, not wanting my usual frustration when dealing with restless middle school boys to get the best of me. 

“I want to be on Andrew’s team, I don’t want to be with Stephen he sucks at this game,” argues Nick.

“You’re on Stephen’s team and you’re going to be nice or you’re out of this round,” I say one last time, raising my voice.

“Fine, I’m not playing,” says Nick. 

The rest of the boys divide themselves up between the two teams and they start to disperse around campus to begin the new round. Nick gets up to go with Andrew’s team, hoping I won’t notice.

“Excuse me, I JUST said you are not playing this round. You sit here with me or you will sit in the office for the rest of the afternoon.” I am now yelling. I sound like my mother. My mother is scary.

Nick comes sulking back. He takes out his iPhone and starts scrolling through it. 

“Please give that to me, you know you can’t have your phone during sports,” I say. He starts to argue and I cut him off with sharp words. My patience is gone. He hands me the phone and starts to complain about how stupid this day is. I try to tune him out and let him be miserable on his own, but the misery is getting to me. I hate yelling at kids. I hate listening to kids complain. I hate feeling this way. I am supposed to be educating them about math and teaching them how to become lifelong learners. Why do I constantly feel awful? What am I doing with my life? Would I feel more useful doing something else?

My mind wanders off to the free course on Codecademy my sister urged me to try out. Both my sister and brother are web developers, my sister a front end developer and my brother a data scientist. Try out coding, they say when I complain about teaching. You’d be good at it and you’d like it.

I try every free course I can get my hands on. I devour basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My brain feels like it hasn’t eaten in years and it wants more. I start the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep and am introduced to Ruby and more JS. I marvel at the complexity of Javascript and the simplicity of Ruby. I get stuck. I write little cliche motivational quotes on sticky notes about grit and perseverance and place them all over my laptop. I take breaks. I go for a run. I take my dog for a walk. I remind myself that there’s always a solution. I come back and the solution is there. This type of hard work is exactly what I teach my own students, but now it’s in my own hands and it feels so wonderful. This is what I was meant to do, I say to myself. 

Fast forward to the next morning. Students start to filter into my classroom. “Ms. Schaller I did my homework!” says a student who rarely does his homework because of his upside down family life at home. I beam at him and make an extra big deal out of this accomplishment. I notice one student who is going through severe mental health issues is absent. I make a note to pull her aside when she’s back to remind her that my classroom is always a safe space for her when she needs it. Students take their seats and get to work on their warmup problems. “I forgot how to do this,” says one student, “I need some help.” My heart swells with pride, because this student never asks for help (but desperately needs to) out of fear of looking stupid. We’ve been working all year to not be afraid to ask for help when he needs it. We walk through the first problem together. He gets the rest by himself. I sit down at my desk and page through a stack of tests I still need to grade, trying to figure out when I’ll have time to get through them all. I notice a note written on the bottom of one of the tests from a student who will graduate next week: “Ms. Schaller, You are my favorite teacher and I am going to truly miss you next year.” I rapidly blink away tears before anyone notices and I decide I’ll grade these tests this afternoon. Teaching is so worth these moments, I say to myself. This is what I was meant to do. Wait, what?

Which one? A career that breaks me down but consistently builds me up? Or one that reaches all the good spots in my brain and makes me feel useful? I realize I am describing both teaching and software development. Can I have both?

Yes, is the answer. To everything. And so continues my journey of teaching, but also begins my journey of software development.
