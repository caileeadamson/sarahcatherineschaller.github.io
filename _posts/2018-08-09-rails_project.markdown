I was set back from my progress at the Flatiron School because of a concussion this past winter/spring. I was out of work for a full month, and unable to read for an additional month after that, so any learning was halted. When I was finally cleared, it was a slow restart to get back to coding. I had been at the end of the Rails section before the concussion happened, and I realized I would have to go back and relearn pretty much everything before starting the Rails Project. To feel like I was making progress on SOMETHING, I started working on the JavaScript course, getting through just a half hour at a time until I felt like I was back in the swing of things and I could tackle the project. Going back through the entire Rails course cemented many topics that I didn't fully understand the first time around, so I'm actually quite grateful I had to do that. I feel like a stronger Rails student because of that experience. Even though I was set back in many areas of my life from the concussion, it taught me a lot!

My Rails Project is a platform for teachers to manage their classrooms and students. A teacher can sign up as a user, create new classrooms, create new students, add students to classrooms, add classrooms to students, and see everything organized in one spot. The entire student body can be viewed by any teacher, as well as a list of students in elementary, middle, and high school.
