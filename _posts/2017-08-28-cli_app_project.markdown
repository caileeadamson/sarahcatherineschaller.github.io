I finally finished my first project, a CLI app that gives you the current weather forecast of 10 major cities spread throughout the U.S. and it feels so good. Like so, so good. The panic and terror I felt before I started the project is long gone, and itâ€™s replaced with confidence in myself and everything I have learned so far from Flatiron. It took me a while to complete the project, because life got in the way and I was unable to consistently work on it for several days at a time. The most challenging part (for me) was remembering to consistently push my changes up to github.

When you start the Weather Forecast app, a list of 10 cities (New York, NY; Boston, MA; San Francisco, CA; Austin, TX; Seattle, WA; Orlando, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Washington, D.C.; Denver, CO; and Hartford, CT) appears. After choosing a city, you are prompted with choices for forecast, temperature, high/low, humidity, and sunrise/sunset. You can go back to this list after making your choice and seeing the result, go back to the main menu of cities, or you can exit the program. In the future, I'd love to change around the cities by switching out names/URLs in a few places to personalize it to places I frequent the most and make it more useful to myself.
